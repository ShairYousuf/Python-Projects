# Python Projects
 A repository to hold my Python Projects

 There are currently 2 projects 

 Poker Hand Checker
 A program that will check and compare hands in a poker game and output who wins.
 Use the Compare hand function and then run the program

 Reaction Game on Arduino
 A reaction game I made on Arduino for a Lab project that outputs your reaction time at the end of the game as a graph. The file also has a firmware install folder if someone wants to recreate what I did. I have made a demonstration video and it is up on youtube link:  https://youtu.be/7ZTZuEbm7r4
